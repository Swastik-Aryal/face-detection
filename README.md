This is a face detection software which uses opencv ( python module ) to detect human faces and encloses them inside a green box.


Before accessing the file make sure to have opencv installed on your PC.

For this, you can either use the command 

" pip install opencv-python "  OR " pip install opencv-contrib-python"

in your terminal.

ENJOYY!!
